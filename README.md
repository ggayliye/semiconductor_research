## Overview of the project
GeO₂ (germanium dioxide) growth on TiO₂ (titanium dioxide) substrate. <br>
Chemical reaction (kinetic) and thermodynamic analysis. ChamCAD utilization on the modeling.

Our work extends the growth of r-GeO2 using metal-organic chemical vapor 
deposition (MOCVD) on an r-TiO2 (001) substrate, utilizing tetraethyl germane as the precursor.

## Useful Abbreviations
- Å : Angstrom, a unit of length. 10^−10 meter. 
- BFOM: "Baliga figure of merit" refers to a metric used in power electronics to evaluate the 
potential of a semiconductor material for high-power applications, specifically considering 
its ability to handle high breakdown voltage while maintaining low on-resistance, essentially 
indicating how effectively a material can minimize conduction losses in a power device; 
a higher Baliga figure of merit signifies better performance in this regard. 
- BPSD : the rate at which a fluid, typically oil, is produced or processed in a refinery, 
measured in "barrels per stream day" - essentially indicating the volume of oil that flows through a 
refining unit over a 24-hour period. 
- Epitaxial Layer: A crystalline film that is deposited on a crystalline substrate.
- MOCVD: Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. 
- SCCM : Standard cubic centimeter per minute. 1 SCCM = 1 cm³|STP/min (STP means tandard temperature 
and pressure (STP) or standard conditions for temperature and pressure ). One example of standard conditions 
for the calculation of SCCM is Tn = 0°C (273.15 K), and pn = 1.01 bar (14.72 psia) and a unity 
compressibility factor Zn  = 1 (i.e., an ideal gas is used for the definition of SCCM).<br>
- Shroud gas : Shroud gas refers to hot combustion gases that are directed onto turbine blades 
by shroud blocks. Shroud blocks are essential for optimal turbine performance. 
- Susceptor rotation:  the turning of a susceptor, which is a surface that can be used in 
semiconductor processing or microwave cooking. Susceptor rotation can affect the quality 
of the material being processed. 
- Torr: A unit of pressure used in measuring partial vacuums. 1 Torr= 133.32 pascals. 1 atm = 101. 325 kPa.
